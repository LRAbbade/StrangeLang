# StrangeLang
Compiler for a new Programming Language called "StrangeLang"

## Execution

To execute, just run `main.py` with the source file path as an argument and the `-f` flag, eg:

```sh
python main.py -f source_file.sl
```

`.sl` is just a mock extension, it will make no difference in execution.

## Testing

There's a predefined test script in `Tests/test.sl`, to run it:

```sh
python main.py --test
```

## Requirements

* Python 3+
